## Tips

- **Search works**: Use the search box to find specific photos by title, artist, or description
- **Filter by collection**: Use the dropdown to show only works from a specific collection
- **Image formats**: Upload JPG, PNG, GIF, or WebP images
- **Backup**: Your changes are saved to files in the `data/json/` folder

## Troubleshooting

**Changes don't appear in gallery:**

- Make sure you refreshed the gallery page after making changes
- Check that you clicked "Save Changes" in the admin panel

**Can't upload images:**

- Try using a different image format (JPG or PNG work best)

**Forgot the password:**
